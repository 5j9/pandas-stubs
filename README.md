## Public type stubs for pandas - WORK IN PROGRESS!

This will be the home for the typing stubs supported by the pandas core team.

The current version of these stubs was copied/forked from the project https://github.com/microsoft/python-type-stubs as follows:

1. Start with the `main` branch at commit `edc791f5e8c7dbae75111b7cc88de5399bcee348`
2. Add PR https://github.com/microsoft/python-type-stubs/pull/188
3. Add PR https://github.com/microsoft/python-type-stubs/pull/190

As both projects move forward, this page will track what the differences are.

## Thanks

We are indebted to Microsoft and that project for the initial set of public type stubs.  We are also grateful for the original pandas-stubs project at https://github.com/VirtusLab/pandas-stubs that created the framework for testing the stubs.
