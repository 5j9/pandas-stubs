Public type stubs for pandas

This will be the home for the typing stubs supported by the pandas core team.

The first version of these stubs was copied from the project https://github.com/microsoft/python-type-stubs based on the version applied after PR https://github.com/microsoft/python-type-stubs/pull/188

We are indebted to Microsoft and that project for the initial set of public type stubs.  We are also grateful for the original pandas-stubs project at https://github.com/VirtusLab/pandas-stubs that created the framework for testing the stubs.
