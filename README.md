# pandas-stubs

## Public type stubs for pandas - WORK IN PROGRESS!

This will be the home for the typing stubs supported by the pandas core team.

The current version of these stubs was copied/forked from the project https://github.com/microsoft/python-type-stubs as of commit `3ea7eb74b1143fc19d3cde337a4ca04dfaa81f66`

As both projects move forward, this page will track what the differences are (if any).

## Thanks

We are indebted to Microsoft and that project for the initial set of public type stubs.  We are also grateful for the original pandas-stubs project at https://github.com/VirtusLab/pandas-stubs that created the framework for testing the stubs.
